In this document, the way of using the code for the following paper is explained.

Imani, Mahdi, and Ulisses Braga-Neto. "Optimal gene regulatory network inference using the
 Boolean Kalman filter and multiple model adaptive estimation." 2015 49th Asilomar Conference
 on Signals, Systems and Computers. IEEE, 2015.

The code is accessible in website {http://people.tamu.edu/~m.imani88/}.\\
 

The function which should be run is

> Net_Inf(net,observ,obs_var,correct_model,threshold,max_time)

The input to the system is as follows:
1- net
It refers to the structure of the model; it contains "net_connection", "net_bias" and "process_noise". 
The unknown part of network connection and bias units should be specified by "?" and different realizations
 of process noise should is in process noise. For example condidering p53-Mdm2 network in the paper we have:

net_connection <- rbind(c(0,   0,  -1,  0),         # Iput to the first gene
                        c(+1,  0, "?", -1),         # Iput to the second gene
                        c(0,  "?", 0, "?")          # Iput to the third gene
                        c(-1, +1, "?",  0))         # Iput to the fourth gene
bias <- c(-1/2,-1/2,-1/2,-1/2)   # bias units for genes
process_noise <- c(0.1,0.15)     # different discrete realizations of process noise

2- observ
The second input to the function is the observation model. For example, the zero mean gaussian noise 
with variance 1 for each state 0 or 1 can be modeled as follows:

obs_mean0 <- c(0)        # mean of p(y|x=0
obs_mean1 <- c(1)        # mean of p(y|x=1) 
obs_variance <- c(0.1)   # variance of P(y|x)
observ <- c(obs_mean0,obs_mean1,obs_variance

3-obs_variables 
The observed variable of states in measurements are defined in this vector.

obs_variables <- c(1:4)   # all four state variables are seen

4- correct_model
The next input is the information of the correct model which will be used in simulation of data.
The correct values of unknonw specified parts of net should be defined in this vector in exact order.  

correct_model <-  c(+1, +1, 0, +1,   # correct elements of net_connection
                  c(),               # correct elements of bias units
                  process_noise[1], # correct process noise
                  obs_variance[1]}) # correct variance of observaition noise

5- threshold, max_time
The method will be stopped if the posterior probability of the inferred model exceeds
 a pre-specified thresholds, or when the method reaches to the maximum number time steps (max_time).

threshold <- 0.90 
max_time <-  200  

The output of the function is always the inferred model for the system. The posterior probability of the 
correct model is also plotted at the end.

>  Net_Inf(net,observ,obs_var,correct_model,threshold,max_time)
The  model is inferred in 41 Time  Steps.
The inferred model: 1.0  1.0  0.0  1.0  0.1  0.1
