# MMAE-BKF
The inference of Boolean gene regulatory networks observed through noise is concern of this package. The algorithm is based on the optimal MMSE state estimator for a Boolean dynamical system, known as the Boolean Kalman Filter (BKF). In the presence of partial knowledge about the network, a bank of BKFs representing the candidate models is run in parallel in a Bayesian framework known as a multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE).
